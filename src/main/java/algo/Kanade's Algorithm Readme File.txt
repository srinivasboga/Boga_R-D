Kadane's Algorithm README
Overview
Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient method for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers. It operates in O(n) time complexity, making it a popular choice for solving the maximum subarray problem.

Key Concepts
Input: An array of integers (which may contain positive and negative values).
Output: The maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
